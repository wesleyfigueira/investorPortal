        <h1>Letter from the CEO</h1>
        <p>
          Dear Investors,<br><br>
          AbleVu was inspired by my time as a special education teacher working with students with Autism and by my best friend Jessica (now my guardian angel), who was a power wheelchair user during our college years together. These experiences led me to create AbleVu — a platform that helps people of all abilities access the world around them with confidence, while empowering businesses and communities to become more inclusive.<br><br>
          In 2023 and 2024, we built and tested our MVP and pilot programs, learning directly from users and partners. This year, 2025, has been our building year. We launched Version 2, introduced our Contributor Program designed to scale accessibility data through community participation, and are preparing to launch our AI product and Version 3 by the end of the year.<br><br>
          Next year, 2026, will focus on sales and revenue growth as we prepare for a larger Seed round in 2027.<br><br>
          We are now raising a $375,000 pre-seed round to bring on key hires in growth, product, and operations. This capital will position us to scale quickly and maximize the impact of our upcoming launches. We expect this raise to move fast and plan to close the round by the end of the year so our team can enter 2026 fully resourced and focused on growth.<br><br>
          Thank you for considering joining us on this journey, combining both social impact and economic impact.<br><br>
          Warmly,<br>
          <strong>Meegan Winters</strong><br>
          CEO / Founder<br>
          AbleVu
